# Put the window entirely inside the ink

Parent card: math:concept:conditional-probability; revision 0.1.0-draft. Original worked draft; independent review pending.

Definition unit math:concept:conditional-probability; revision 0.1.0-draft. Setting: Conditional probability on a continuous uniform location model over one 100 cm strip. Expression: $P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{\min(a,b)}{b},\quad P(A)=\frac{a}{100},\quad P(B)=\frac{b}{100},\quad b>0.$. Conditions required for a defined value (a case may test their violation): A location is chosen uniformly along a 100 cm strip. Probabilities of intervals equal their lengths divided by 100 cm. The inked event A is the first a cm and inspection event B is the first b cm: 0≤a≤100 cm and 0<b≤100 cm. The two intervals share their left endpoint, so their overlap length is min(a,b). This specimen does not realize every relationship between two events. Conditioning divides the overlap probability by positive P(B); a zero-length conditioning window is excluded. Scope: Generally, P(A|B)=P(A∩B)/P(B) for P(B)>0. The first frame shares a physical length scale; the second explicitly normalizes B to unit probability. This does not alter P(A).

Case unit math:example:conditional-probability:contained-window. Setting: An originally authored workshop scenario with stipulated quantities and rules. Inputs: {"eventEnd": 24, "windowEnd": 12}. Result: {"exact": "P(A|B)=1"}. Limits: Containment does not establish independence.

## Complete worked case

- id: math:example:conditional-probability:contained-window
- title: Put the window entirely inside the ink
- role: applied_model
- question: Can a location in the first 12 cm miss an inked prefix of 24 cm?
- setting: An originally authored workshop scenario with stipulated quantities and rules.
- assumptions:
  - A location is chosen uniformly along a 100 cm strip. Probabilities of intervals equal their lengths divided by 100 cm.
  - The inked event A is the first a cm and inspection event B is the first b cm: 0≤a≤100 cm and 0<b≤100 cm.
  - The two intervals share their left endpoint, so their overlap length is min(a,b). This specimen does not realize every relationship between two events.
  - Conditioning divides the overlap probability by positive P(B); a zero-length conditioning window is excluded.
- inputs:
  - eventEnd: 24
  - windowEnd: 12
- steps:
  - Item:
    - index: 1
    - expression: min(24,12)=12 cm
    - reason: The shorter prefix is entirely inked.
  - Item:
    - index: 2
    - expression: P(A∩B)=12/100=P(B)
    - reason: The overlap and conditioning window coincide.
  - Item:
    - index: 3
    - expression: P(A|B)=0.12/0.12=1
    - reason: Every location remaining after the report is inked.
- result:
  - exact: P(A|B)=1
- interpretation: The original ink probability remains 0.24 even though the conditioned probability is one.
- independent check:
  - method: Separate exact arithmetic check
  - expected: Check B⊆A; with positive P(B), the intersection is B.
- limits: Containment does not establish independence.
- preset:
  - eventEnd: 24
  - windowEnd: 12
- provenance:
  - kind: original worked derivation
  - mathematical review: author-derived; independent review pending
  - external source refs:
- conditions to check:
  - A location is chosen uniformly along a 100 cm strip. Probabilities of intervals equal their lengths divided by 100 cm.
  - The inked event A is the first a cm and inspection event B is the first b cm: 0≤a≤100 cm and 0<b≤100 cm.
  - The two intervals share their left endpoint, so their overlap length is min(a,b). This specimen does not realize every relationship between two events.
  - Conditioning divides the overlap probability by positive P(B); a zero-length conditioning window is excluded.

- compute: A and B are prefixes of the same 100 cm strip. P(A)=a/100; P(B)=b/100; P(A∩B)=min(a,b)/100. For b>0, P(A|B)=min(a,b)/b.
- numeric tolerance: 1e-10
- invariants:
  - A location is chosen uniformly along a 100 cm strip. Probabilities of intervals equal their lengths divided by 100 cm.
  - The inked event A is the first a cm and inspection event B is the first b cm: 0≤a≤100 cm and 0<b≤100 cm.
  - The two intervals share their left endpoint, so their overlap length is min(a,b). This specimen does not realize every relationship between two events.
  - Conditioning divides the overlap probability by positive P(B); a zero-length conditioning window is excluded.
- limits:
  - Constructed uniform-location model with nested prefixes; no measured quality-control or defect-rate inference.
  - The normalized conditional frame has a different extent from the physical strip and is labeled accordingly.
  - A zero-probability conditioning event is rejected rather than silently assigned a probability.
- fallback: Pause to read the quantities. Worked steps, the graph, model-data table and searchable definitions provide text and numeric alternatives.
